# Firebase Authentication Setup Guide

## Quick Setup Steps

Your Firebase project credentials are already configured, but you need to enable Authentication in the Firebase Console.

### Step 1: Enable Firebase Authentication

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Select your project**: `resume-4036a`
3. **Navigate to Authentication**:
   - Click on "Authentication" in the left sidebar
   - If you see "Get started", click it
   - If already set up, proceed to next step

### Step 2: Enable Email/Password Sign-in

1. **Go to Sign-in method tab**
2. **Find "Email/Password" provider**
3. **Click on "Email/Password"**
4. **Toggle "Enable" to ON**
5. **Click "Save"**

### Step 3: Enable Firestore Database

1. **Click on "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar**
2. **Click "Create database"** (if not already created)
3. **Choose "Start in test mode"** for development
4. **Select your preferred location**
5. **Click "Done"**

### Step 4: Test the Application

After completing the above steps:
1. Refresh your Streamlit app
2. Try creating a new account
3. The authentication should now work properly

## Current Status

✅ Firebase Admin SDK credentials configured  
✅ Firebase Web SDK configuration ready  
❌ Firebase Authentication not enabled (causing the error)  
❌ Firestore Database not enabled  

## Error Explanation

The error "No auth provider found for the given identifier (CONFIGURATION_NOT_FOUND)" means:
- Your Firebase project exists
- The credentials are correct
- But the Authentication service is not enabled in Firebase Console

This is a common setup step that needs to be done in the Firebase Console web interface.

## Alternative: Use Without Authentication

You can still use all the core features of the resume builder without authentication:
- Resume generation
- ATS analysis
- PDF export
- All templates and customization options

Authentication is only needed for:
- Saving resumes to your account
- User profiles
- Resume history
